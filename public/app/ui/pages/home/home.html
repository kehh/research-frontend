    <h1>Research Western Australian History</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the gateway for searching the catalogues of The Royal Western Australian Historical Societyâ€™s historical collections.
        The items embraced by these records have been collected and managed by the Society since 1926 and include a wealth of information on many aspects of Western Australian history dating back to European settlement in 1826, with some going back even further.
    </p>
    <p>
        The catalogues cover the <a href="/library/search">Library</a>, <a href="/museum/search">Museum</a>, <a href="/photographs/search">Photographs</a> and <a href="/memorials/search">Public Memorials</a> collections.
        You can also <a href="/all/search">search across the collections</a>.
        These catalogues have been made accessible via the web so that users can search them from anywhere in the world for historical research and general interest purposes.
